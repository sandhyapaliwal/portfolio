 <h2> ABOUT MOVIE</h2>
<p> The major themes in The Pursuit of Happyness are : The American Dream - Chris Gardner strived for his ideal of the American dream.
   He worked hard and seized opportunities for success and prosperity. He longed for a good job, a happy family, an education for his son, 
   and a stable home.Everyone has the right to actuallybe happy, not just try to be happy. To use a metaphor: You don't just get the chance 
   to make the baseball team, you are guaranteed a spot.</p>
